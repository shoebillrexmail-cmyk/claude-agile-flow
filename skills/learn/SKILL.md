description: Extract learnings from a completed story — generate educational writeups, patterns, and integration guides in the Obsidian vault
---

After a story is completed, extract what was learned and write it up. Learnings are classified as **cross-cutting** (shared across all projects in `_Knowledge/`) or **project-specific** (kept in the project's `Learning/` folder).

This skill is triggered automatically by `/agile-flow:done` after a story moves to Done, or manually via `/agile-flow:learn`.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — Story name (e.g. `STORY-auth-login`). If empty, detect from branch name.
- `--skip` — Skip learning extraction (for trivial changes)

## Step 1: Gather Context

1. Find the vault path from `CLAUDE.md` under `## Obsidian Project`
2. Determine the story from branch name or argument
3. Read the story file — extract specialist context, testing strategy, acceptance criteria
4. Read linked specs
5. Gather the change context:
   - `git diff develop...HEAD --stat` — scope of changes
   - `git log develop..HEAD --oneline` — commit history (tells the story of development)
   - Review findings (if `/agile-flow:review` ran) — what was caught and fixed
   - Specialist feedback captured in the story
6. Read existing sources to check for related prior learnings:
   - `C:\Obsidian_Vaults\_Knowledge\Index.md` — shared knowledge base
   - Project's `Learning/Index.md` — project-specific learnings

## Step 2: Assess What Was Learned

Analyze the gathered context and classify learnings into categories:

### Category Detection

| Signal | Category | Output |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Story involved a technology/service not previously used in the project | **Integration Guide** | `GUIDE-<name>.md` |
| Review found bugs that reveal a reusable anti-pattern | **Pattern** | `PATTERN-<name>.md` |
| A concrete mistake with a specific fix that others must avoid | **Gotcha** | `GOTCHA-<name>.md` |
| Story solved a complex problem with a non-obvious approach | **Writeup** | `WRITEUP-<name>.md` |
| Specialist agent provided guidance that was key to success | **Writeup** or **Pattern** | Depends on depth |
| Story was routine with no novel learnings | **Skip** | No output (note in story: "No new learnings") |

### Cross-Cutting vs Project-Specific Classification

After identifying a learning, classify WHERE it belongs:

| Criterion | Cross-cutting (`_Knowledge/`) | Project-specific (`Learning/`) |
|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Applies to other projects?** | Yes — any project using this tech/pattern would benefit | No — only relevant to this project's architecture |
| **Domain-general?** | Yes — tied to a technology, language, or framework | No — tied to this project's specific design decisions |
| **Would another team hit this?** | Yes — it's a common trap or useful pattern | No — it's about this codebase's internals |
| **Examples** | "Never pass signer on OPNet frontend", "React useEffect stale closure gotcha", "Always simulate before sendTransaction" | "Our auth middleware uses X pattern", "The staking page layout follows Y convention" |

**Rule of thumb**: If you have to name the project to explain why it matters, it's project-specific. If you can explain it in terms of the technology alone, it's cross-cutting.

### Novelty Check

Before creating a learning, check BOTH locations for duplicates:

1. **Check `_Knowledge/`** — grep for similar entries by name, domain, and description
   - If a similar entry exists → **update** it (add new example, increment occurrences, update `last_verified`)
2. **Check project `Learning/`** — grep for similar entries
   - If a similar entry exists → **update** it instead of creating a duplicate
3. If genuinely new → create in the appropriate location

A story can produce multiple learnings (e.g., one cross-cutting gotcha + one project-specific writeup).

## Step 3: Generate Learnings

All learning documents use **frontmatter** for structured metadata:

```yaml
---
type: gotcha | pattern | guide | writeup
domain: [opnet, react, typescript, testing, ...]
severity: critical | high | medium | low
source_project: <project-name>
source_story: STORY-<name>
date_created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD
status: active | deprecated | superseded
superseded_by: (link if replaced)
---
```

### Gotcha (`_Knowledge/Gotchas/GOTCHA-<name>.md`)

**When**: A concrete mistake was made (or nearly made) that has a specific, actionable fix. The "don't do X because Y" format.

**Destination**: Almost always cross-cutting — gotchas are by nature things any project could hit.

```markdown
---
type: gotcha
domain: [<domains>]
severity: <severity>
source_project: <project>
source_story: STORY-<name>
date_created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD
status: active
superseded_by:
---

```

### Pattern (`PATTERN-<name>.md`)

**When**: A review finding, a bug, or a specialist warning revealed a reusable pattern or anti-pattern.

**Destination**: Cross-cutting if it applies to the technology generally. Project-specific if it's about this project's conventions.

- Cross-cutting → `_Knowledge/Patterns/PATTERN-<name>.md`
- Project-specific → `Learning/Patterns/PATTERN-<name>.md`

### Integration Guide (`GUIDE-<name>.md`)

**When**: The story involved connecting to a new API, using a new library, integrating a new service, or implementing a new protocol for the first time.

**Destination**: Cross-cutting if the guide applies to any project using this technology. Project-specific if it's about this project's specific integration setup.

- Cross-cutting → `_Knowledge/Guides/GUIDE-<name>.md`
- Project-specific → `Learning/Integrations/GUIDE-<name>.md`

```markdown

type: guide
domain: [<domains>]
severity: medium
source_project: <project>

### Writeup (`WRITEUP-<name>.md`)

**When**: The story involved a complex problem, a non-obvious solution, or a significant architectural decision that others (or future-you) would benefit from understanding deeply.

**Destination**: Cross-cutting if the approach generalizes beyond this project. Project-specific if it's about this project's specific architecture.

- Cross-cutting → `_Knowledge/Writeups/WRITEUP-<name>.md`
- Project-specific → `Learning/Writeups/WRITEUP-<name>.md`

```markdown

type: writeup
domain: [<domains>]
severity: medium
source_project: <project>
source_story: STORY-<name>

## Step 4: Update Indexes

### Cross-cutting entries → update `_Knowledge/Index.md`

Add the entry under the appropriate domain and severity heading:

```markdown
## <Domain>

### <Severity>
- [GOTCHA-<name>](Gotchas/GOTCHA-<name>.md) — one-line summary
- [PATTERN-<name>](Patterns/PATTERN-<name>.md) — one-line summary
- [GUIDE-<name>](Guides/GUIDE-<name>.md) — one-line summary
- [WRITEUP-<name>](Writeups/WRITEUP-<name>.md) — one-line summary
```

If the entry's domain doesn't have a section yet, create one with Critical/High/Medium subheadings.

### Project-specific entries → update `Learning/Index.md`

Update the project's `Learning/Index.md` with the new entries in the existing table format:

```markdown
## Integration Guides
| Guide | Technology | Confidence | Stories |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| [[GUIDE-<name>]] | [tech] | [Low/Med/High] | [[STORY-<name>]] |

## Patterns
| Pattern | Type | Severity | Domain | Occurrences |
|---------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| [[PATTERN-<name>]] | [Anti-pattern/Best Practice/Gotcha] | [sev] | [domain] | [N] |

## Writeups
| Writeup | Domain | Difficulty | Date |
|---------|--------|------------|------|
| [[WRITEUP-<name>]] | [domain] | [level] | YYYY-MM-DD |
```

## Step 5: Link Back to Story

Add a `## Learnings` section to the completed story file:

```markdown
## Learnings

### Cross-cutting (in _Knowledge/)
- [[_Knowledge/Gotchas/GOTCHA-<name>]] — [brief description]
- [[_Knowledge/Patterns/PATTERN-<name>]] — [brief description]

### Project-specific (in Learning/)
- [[Learning/Integrations/GUIDE-<name>]] — [brief description]
- [[Learning/Writeups/WRITEUP-<name>]] — [brief description]
```

If all learnings are in one location, omit the subheadings.

## Step 6: Report to User

Present the generated learnings:

```
## Learnings from STORY-<name>

Generated {N} learning documents:

### Cross-cutting (_Knowledge/ — shared across all projects)
- GOTCHA-<name>: [title] — [one-line summary]
- PATTERN-<name>: [title] — [one-line summary]

### Project-specific (Learning/)
- GUIDE-<name>: [title] — [one-line summary]
- WRITEUP-<name>: [title] — [one-line summary]

Cross-cutting entries are in C:\Obsidian_Vaults\_Knowledge\.
Project entries are in your project's Learning/ folder.
```

If no learnings were generated (routine story), report: "No new learnings from this story — all patterns were already documented."

## Updating Existing Learnings

When a learning already exists for a topic:

**Integration Guides**: Add the new story's experience:
- Update "Last updated" date and `last_verified` in frontmatter
- Add new gotchas/pitfalls if discovered
- Increase "Confidence" level if appropriate (more usage = more confidence)
- Add story to "Contributors" list

**Patterns**: Increment occurrence count:
- Add new story to "Occurrences" list
- Update `last_verified` in frontmatter
- If the pattern was seen 3+ times, flag it: "This is a recurring pattern — consider adding a linter rule or pre-commit check"
- Update code examples if the new occurrence has a better illustration

**Gotchas**: Update with new context:
- Update `last_verified` in frontmatter
- Add new examples or detection methods if discovered
- If the gotcha has evolved (e.g., framework changed the API), update the fix

**Promoting project-specific to cross-cutting**: If a learning was initially project-specific but has now been encountered in a second project:
1. Move the file from `Learning/<type>/` to `_Knowledge/<type>/`
2. Update `source_project` to list both projects
3. Remove from project `Learning/Index.md`, add to `_Knowledge/Index.md`
4. Update wiki-links in both story files

## Notes

- Learning extraction is non-blocking — if it fails, the story still completes
- Users can run `/agile-flow:learn` manually on any completed story
- Writeups should be educational in tone — written for someone encountering this for the first time
- Code examples should be annotated with WHY comments, not just WHAT
- When updating existing learnings, never remove content — only add
- The `_Knowledge/` folder is shared across ALL projects — entries there are global
- The project `Learning/` folder remains for project-specific architecture decisions and conventions
- If a learning exists in both `_Knowledge/` and a project `Learning/`, the `_Knowledge/` version is authoritative
